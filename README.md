## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
## Usage
### Running the Development Server

To start the development server and run your project locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
This will launch the development server, and you can view your project in a web browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port in your configuration).

Building for Production
When you're ready to deploy your project, you can build it for production using the following command:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate optimized and minified files in the dist or build directory, ready for deployment to a web server.

Customizing Configuration
If you need to customize the configuration or adjust settings, you can do so in the webpack.config.js file. This file contains various options for configuring Webpack, such as entry points, output paths, and loaders for different file types.

Using Custom Scripts
Feel free to add your own custom npm scripts to the package.json file based on your project's needs. For example, you might want to create scripts for testing, linting, or other tasks relevant to your workflow.
```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest",
  "lint": "eslint src"
}
```

## Configuration

### Webpack Setup

The project uses Webpack for bundling and configuring assets. The main configuration file is `webpack.config.js`. Customize this file to adjust entry points, output paths, and loaders for different file types.

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: __dirname + '/dist',
  },
  // Add loaders, plugins, and other configurations as needed
};
```

npm start: Start the development server.
npm build: Build the project for production.
